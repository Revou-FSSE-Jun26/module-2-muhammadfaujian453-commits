## Overview
This repository contains a robust, scalable backend API designed for a multi-tenant e-commerce platform. Built with Python and Flask, it utilizes a single-database configuration for Flask using PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy. The architecture enforces strict domain boundaries, separating buyers, sellers, and system administrators, making it a highly structured foundation for complex marketplace operations.

The codebase follows a layered **Model-Controller-Service (MCS)** architecture with a dedicated **Marshmallow DTO (Data Transfer Object)** layer for request validation and response serialization — see [Architecture](#architecture) below for the full breakdown. Beyond the application code, this project is fully **containerized with Docker** and **live-deployed on Railway** — see [Containerization](#containerization-docker) and [Cloud Architecture](#cloud-architecture-railway).

## Core Architectural Features
*   **Split-Order Checkout System:** Intelligently dissects a single user cart into multiple isolated orders based on distinct seller IDs, ensuring accurate logistics and financial segregation.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Secures endpoints using JWT authentication, strictly restricting data mutation operations based on user roles (Admin, Seller, Buyer).
*   **Resilient Data Management:** Implements comprehensive soft-deletion mechanisms across users, stores, products, and orders to maintain referential integrity without destroying historical transaction data.
*   **Multi-Level Category Hierarchy:** Categories support a self-referencing parent-child structure, letting products live under a specific subcategory (e.g., "Circuit Breakers & MCBs" under "Electrical & Panels") while `GET /categories` still returns a clean, navigable top-level tree with subcategories nested inside.
*   **UUID-Identified Orders:** Order records use randomly generated UUIDs instead of sequential integers, closing off order-number enumeration attacks (IDOR) where a bad actor could simply guess adjacent order IDs.
*   **Enforced Order Status State Machine:** Status changes must follow a strict, explicit progression — no role, including admin, can skip lifecycle stages (see [Order Lifecycle State Machine](#order-lifecycle-state-machine)).
*   **Dynamic Data Filtering:** Provides robust product discovery through dynamic querying (price ranges, category IDs, text search) combined with offset pagination.
*   **Automated Slug Generation:** Prevents URL collisions by automatically generating unique, SEO-friendly product slugs embedded with UUIDs, directly retrievable via `GET /products/slug/{slug}`.
*   **Layered MCS + DTO Architecture:** Business logic is fully decoupled from HTTP handling via a dedicated Service layer, with Marshmallow schemas enforcing strict request/response contracts at the boundary.
*   **Product Deletion Guard:** Blocks the deletion of any product still tied to an order in `pending`, `processing`, or `shipped` status, protecting in-flight transactions from data integrity issues. Deletable by the product's owning seller **or** by an admin (e.g., to remove a listing that violates marketplace policy).

## Architecture

This API follows a **Model-Controller-Service (MCS)** pattern, augmented with a **DTO (Data Transfer Object) layer** powered by Marshmallow. Each layer has a single, well-defined responsibility:

```

```

**Request flow for a typical write operation** (e.g. `POST /products`):

1.  **Controller** receives the HTTP request and extracts the JWT identity.
2.  **Schema** (`ProductCreateSchema`) validates and coerces the incoming JSON — malformed or missing fields are rejected with a `400` before any business logic runs.
3.  **Service** (`product_service.create_product`) executes the actual business rules and database operations, returning either the created record or a structured error — it never touches Flask's `request` or `jsonify` directly.
4.  **Controller** translates the service's result: on success, a response **Schema** (`ProductResponseSchema`) serializes the model into JSON; on failure, the service's error message and status code are returned as-is.

This keeps controllers thin (parsing and delegating only), keeps business logic testable in isolation from HTTP (see `tests/test_services.py`), and centralizes the request/response contract per resource in one place instead of scattering it across manual validation and `to_dict()` methods.

## Business Logic & System Workflows

### 1. The Split-Order Architecture
When a buyer places items from multiple different sellers into a single cart and initiates a checkout, the system does not create a monolithic order. Instead, the transaction engine groups the cart items by `seller_id`. It then generates distinct, independent `Order` records for each seller. This allows each seller to update their logistics status independently without interfering with other sellers' fulfillment processes.
> **Visual Proof: Split-Order Execution**
![Postman showing POST/checkout returning multiple created orders in the JSON response](assets/img_readme/splitorder.png)

### 2. Cascading Soft-Deletion
To preserve financial audit trails and prevent `IntegrityError` on foreign keys, records are rarely hard-deleted.
* If a User is deleted, their account is flagged as inactive.
* If that User is also a Seller, the `Sellers` profile is deactivated.
* Subsequently, all `Products` belonging to that seller are automatically pulled from the public catalog via an `is_active=False` flag.
* Previous `Orders` involving these deleted entities remain perfectly intact for bookkeeping — each order's UUID identifier stays permanently resolvable regardless of whether the buyer or seller account tied to it is later deactivated, so financial history is never orphaned.

### 3. Product Deletion Guard
Deleting a product is not a simple flag flip. Before a product can be soft-deleted, the system checks whether it is referenced by any `OrderItems` belonging to an `Order` still in `pending`, `processing`, or `shipped` status. If such a reference exists, the deletion is rejected with a `409 Conflict` — a seller cannot pull a product out from under a customer's in-flight order. Once every order referencing the product reaches a terminal state (`delivered` or `cancelled`), the same request succeeds. This action is available to the product's owning seller, or to an admin acting independently of ownership (e.g., removing a listing that violates marketplace policy).

### 4. Order Deletion Constraint
`Orders` are treated as append-mostly financial records, not freely-erasable resources. `DELETE /orders/{id}` performs a **soft delete** — flipping `is_active` to `false`, never removing the row — and only succeeds when the order's `status` is `cancelled`; any order still `pending`, `processing`, `shipped`, or already `delivered` is rejected, preserving both in-flight transactions and the completed sales history used for reporting.

---

## Order Lifecycle State Machine

The `status` column on `orders` only allows specific forward transitions, enforced centrally in `order_service.update_order_status()` — no role, including admin, can bypass this table:

```
pending ──→ processing ──→ shipped ──→ delivered
   │             │
   └─────────────┴──────────────────────────→ cancelled
```

| From \ To | `processing` | `shipped` | `delivered` | `cancelled` |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **`pending`** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ *(buyer or admin)* |
| **`processing`** | — | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ *(admin only)* |
| **`shipped`** | — | — | ✅ | ❌ |
| **`delivered`** | — | — | — | ❌ *(terminal)* |
| **`cancelled`** | — | — | — | ❌ *(terminal)* |

Any request attempting a transition outside this table — regardless of role — is rejected with `409 Conflict`. Cancelling an order restores stock for every item in it (see [Cascading Soft-Deletion](#2-cascading-soft-deletion)).

---

## Database Schema

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
> **Note:** Below is the visual representation of the database schema. `ORDERS.id` and `ORDER_ITEMS.order_id` are UUIDs; `CATEGORIES` is self-referencing to support the subcategory hierarchy.
```mermaid
erDiagram
    USERS ||--o| SELLERS : "has profile (1:1)"
    USERS ||--o{ ORDERS : "places as buyer"
    USERS ||--o| CARTS : "owns"
    SELLERS ||--o{ PRODUCTS : "manages inventory"
    SELLERS ||--o{ ORDERS : "receives as seller"
    CATEGORIES ||--o{ PRODUCTS : "categorizes"
    CATEGORIES ||--o{ CATEGORIES : "has subcategories"
    CARTS ||--o{ CART_ITEMS : "holds"
    PRODUCTS ||--o{ CART_ITEMS : "added to"
    ORDERS ||--o{ ORDER_ITEMS : "contains"
    PRODUCTS ||--o{ ORDER_ITEMS : "purchased as"

    USERS {
        int id PK
        string email
        string role
        boolean is_active
    }
    SELLERS {
        int id PK, FK "References users.id"
        string store_name
        boolean is_active
    }
    PRODUCTS {
        int id PK
        int seller_id FK
        int category_id FK
        string slug
        numeric price
        int stock
        boolean is_active
    }
    CATEGORIES {
        int id PK
        int parent_id FK "Self-referencing, nullable"
        string name
    }
    ORDERS {
        uuid id PK
        int user_id FK "Buyer ID"
        int seller_id FK
        string status
        boolean is_active
    }
    ORDER_ITEMS {
        uuid order_id PK, FK
        int product_id PK, FK
        int quantity
    }
    CARTS {
        int id PK
        int user_id FK
    }
    CART_ITEMS {
        int cart_id PK, FK
        int product_id PK, FK
        int quantity
    }
```
The database is heavily normalized to ensure data integrity across the marketplace. Frequently filtered and sorted columns (`orders.status`, `orders.created_at`, `products.category_id`, `products.seller_id`, `carts.user_id`, `categories.parent_id`) are backed by explicit indexes for query performance at scale.

| Table Name | Primary Purpose | Key Relationships |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`users`** | Central identity management and authentication. | 1:1 with `sellers`, 1:1 with `carts`, 1:M with `orders`. |
| **`sellers`** | Store profiles for users who register to sell. | PK is an FK to `users.id`. 1:M with `products`. |
| **`categories`** | Master data for product classification, supporting a self-referencing parent-child hierarchy (top-level categories and subcategories underneath them). | 1:M with `products`; self-referencing 1:M for subcategories via `parent_id`. |
| **`products`** | Inventory catalog with auto-generated slugs, independently retrievable via `GET /products/slug/{slug}`. | Belongs to `categories` and `sellers`. |
| **`carts` & `cart_items`** | Temporary states for pre-checkout items. | M:N association between `users` and `products`. |
| **`orders` & `order_items`**| Transaction records identified by UUID (not sequential integers) to prevent order-number guessing, soft-deletable only once `cancelled` (see [Order Deletion Constraint](#4-order-deletion-constraint)). | Bridges `users` (buyer) and `sellers`. |

## Automated Testing & Quality Assurance

This backend is safeguarded by a comprehensive **End-to-End (E2E) Test Suite** built with `pytest`, organized into **class-based test suites** (`TestAuthAPI`, `TestProductAPI`, `TestOrderAPI`, `TestSellerAPI`, `TestCategoryAPI`, `TestCartAPI`) backed by session- and function-scoped fixtures in `conftest.py`. The test architecture utilizes isolated SQLite in-memory databases with per-test rollbacks, ensuring zero data leakage between test executions. Every push and pull request against `main` automatically triggers this full suite via **GitHub Actions**.

*   **Positive & Negative Testing:** Validates data boundaries (e.g., rejecting negative stock quantities or zero-priced items).
*   **Security Validations:** Actively tests against Horizontal Privilege Escalation (IDOR), ensuring buyers cannot access or modify orders belonging to other accounts.
*   **State Machine Enforcement:** Verifies that illegal order status jumps (e.g., `pending` directly to `delivered`) are rejected with `409`, regardless of the caller's role.
*   **Anomaly Prevention:** Halts checkout executions involving "Ghost Products" (items soft-deleted by sellers while still resting in a buyer's cart).
*   **Isolated Unit Tests:** `tests/test_services.py` (`TestProductService`, `TestAuthMiddleware`) tests pure business logic — slug generation, password hashing — directly against the service and middleware layers, with no Flask request/response cycle involved.

## Load Testing (Locust)

Performance under concurrent load is verified with `locustfile.py`, simulating two weighted, realistic traffic scenarios against a running instance of the API:

| User Class | Weight | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `BrowsingUser` | 75% of traffic | Fetches the product catalog and views random product detail pages — no authentication required. |
| `BuyingUser` | 25% of traffic | Logs in, browses the catalog, adds a random product to the cart, checks out, and reviews order history. |

To run a load test locally:
```bash
# In one terminal, run the API
flask run

# In another terminal, run Locust against it
locust -f locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:5000
```
Then open [http://localhost:8089](http://localhost:8089) in your browser to configure the number of simulated users and spawn rate, and start the test from the Locust web UI.

---

## Infrastructure & Deployment Readiness

Beyond passing its own test suite, this API includes several production-hardening measures that only become relevant once real traffic and real hosting are involved:

*   **Structured, Platform-Aware Logging:** Uses Python's `logging` module (not `print()`) with a console handler that integrates with any hosting platform's log dashboard. File-based rotating logs are only enabled when `IS_PRODUCTION` is unset — this avoids writing to disk on platforms with an ephemeral filesystem (like Railway), where local log files are wiped on every redeploy.
*   **Database Connection Resilience:** `SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS` is configured with `pool_pre_ping=True` and a `pool_recycle` interval, preventing the common "server closed the connection unexpectedly" failure that occurs when a managed Postgres provider silently drops idle connections.
*   **Rate Limiting:** `Flask-Limiter` protects `POST /auth/login` (5/minute) and `POST /users` (10/hour) against brute-force and registration-spam attacks.
    > ⚠️ **Known limitation:** the current rate limiter uses in-memory storage, which is *not* shared across Gunicorn's multiple worker processes — under `--workers 2`, the effective limit is roughly double the configured value, since each worker tracks its own counters independently. A Redis-backed store closes this gap; see [Future Enhancements](#future-enhancements).
*   **Environment-Aware CORS:** Allowed origins are controlled via the `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable rather than hardcoded, so the same codebase can run wide-open in development and locked-down in production.
*   **Fail-Fast Configuration:** The app refuses to start if `DATABASE_URL` or `JWT_SECRET_KEY` are missing, rather than silently falling back to an insecure default.
*   **Database Scheme Normalization:** `config.py` automatically rewrites a legacy `postgres://` connection string (as issued by some hosting providers, including Railway) into the `postgresql://` scheme SQLAlchemy 1.4+ requires — without this, the app would crash on startup on those providers.
*   **Health Check with Correct HTTP Semantics:** `GET /health` returns `200 {"status": "healthy", "database": "connected"}` when the database is reachable and `503 {"status": "unhealthy", ...}` when it is not — letting Railway or any external uptime monitor detect failures from the HTTP status code alone, without needing to parse the response body.
*   **Continuous Integration:** Every push and pull request runs the full `pytest` suite via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`), catching regressions before they reach `main`.

---

## Containerization (Docker)

The application is fully containerized — the same `Dockerfile` in this repository is what builds the image actually running in production (see [Cloud Architecture](#cloud-architecture-railway)), not a separate demo file.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip \
    && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

RUN useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash appuser \
    && chown -R appuser:appuser /app
USER appuser

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["sh", "-c", "exec gunicorn run:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 2"]
```

A few deliberate choices worth calling out:
*   **Non-root user (`appuser`):** the app never runs as root inside the container, following the Principle of Least Privilege — if the application layer is ever compromised, the blast radius is limited to an unprivileged user.
*   **`exec` in the CMD:** ensures Gunicorn runs as PID 1 and receives shutdown signals (`SIGTERM`) directly, enabling graceful shutdowns instead of an abrupt kill.
*   **`$PORT` binding:** the container binds to whatever port the hosting platform injects at runtime rather than a hardcoded value — required by Railway, Render, and most modern PaaS providers.

**Run it locally:**
```bash
docker build -t multivendor-api .

docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="your-database-url" \
  -e JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key" \
  -e PORT=8000 \
  multivendor-api
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000/health` — a healthy response returns `{"status": "healthy", "database": "connected"}`.

## Cloud Architecture (Railway)

This API is deployed on **Railway**, a container-native PaaS. A single Railway project hosts two services that communicate over Railway's private network:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Developer: git push] --> B[GitHub Repository]
    B -->|Webhook trigger| C[Railway: Build via Dockerfile]
    C --> D[Web Service Container]
    D <-->|Private network<br/>postgres.railway.internal| E[(PostgreSQL Service)]
    E -.->|TCP Proxy / Public Networking<br/>external tools only| F[DBeaver - Local Machine]
    D --> G[Public Domain<br/>*.up.railway.app]
```

*   **Web Service:** built directly from this repository's `Dockerfile` on every push to `main` — no Nixpacks auto-detection or Procfile involved, since the Dockerfile's `CMD` already fully specifies how the app starts. Railway injects the runtime `PORT`, which Gunicorn binds to dynamically.
*   **PostgreSQL Service:** a managed Postgres instance, private by default. The Web Service connects to it using Railway's internal service reference (`${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`) rather than a manually copy-pasted connection string — this resolves automatically at deploy time, uses the private network (no egress cost, lower latency), and never needs updating if the database credentials rotate.
*   **TCP Proxy (Public Networking):** disabled by default for security — explicitly enabled on the Postgres service to expose a `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`, used *only* for connecting external tools (e.g. DBeaver) and running one-off administrative commands (schema migrations, seeding) from a local machine. The application itself never uses this public URL.
*   **Environment Variables:** `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, and `IS_PRODUCTION` are configured directly on the Web Service, separate from the database credentials.

### Managing the production database (migrations & seeding)
Because this project runs on Railway's free trial tier (no shell access), schema migrations and seed data are applied from a local machine, explicitly pointed at the production database for a single command only — the local `.env` file is never modified for this:
```bash
# Apply schema migrations
DATABASE_URL="<DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL from Railway>" flask db upgrade

# Populate the live database with a business-realistic dataset
DATABASE_URL="<DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL from Railway>" python seed.py
```
`seed.py` checks for existing records before inserting, so it is safe to re-run against production at any time without creating duplicates.

---

## Installation & Initialization

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory.
2. Initialize and activate a Python virtual environment.
3. Install the necessary dependencies. For local development and running the test suite (this also installs Pytest and Locust):
```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
   For a production-only install (no test or load-testing tools), use `pip install -r requirements.txt` instead.

4. Configure your `.env` file (use `.env.example` as a starting point) with the required environment variables:
```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your_db
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secure_secret_key
   FLASK_APP=run.py
```
5. Apply the schema migrations to your PostgreSQL database:
```bash
   flask db upgrade
```
6. Populate the database with a rich, business-realistic dataset — 4 sellers across 3 industries (electrical components, confectionery, office supplies, plus a dedicated load-testing store), a full category hierarchy with subcategories, a discontinued product example, and an order history spanning every lifecycle status across returning customers:
```bash
   python seed.py
```
7. Run the development server:
```bash
   flask run
```
   Or, for a production-style run using Gunicorn:
```bash
   gunicorn run:app
```
   Or, to run it exactly as it runs in production, via Docker — see [Containerization](#containerization-docker).

## Interactive API Documentation (Swagger)

This system is thoroughly documented using **Flasgger**.

Once the local development server is running, navigate to the following URL in your browser to access the interactive Swagger UI and test endpoints directly:
👉 **[http://127.0.0.1:5000/swagger-ui/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/swagger-ui/)**

The same documentation is also available on the live deployment — see the [Live API Documentation](#multivendor-e-commerce-backend) link at the top of this README.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST` | `/categories` | Create category or subcategory | Protected by `@roles_required('admin')`; accepts optional `parent_id` to nest under an existing category. | ✅ |
| `GET` | `/categories` | List top-level categories | Returns each category with its subcategories nested inside; no auth required. | ✅ |
| `GET` | `/categories/{id}` | Get a category by ID | Returns the category's active products; `404` for a non-existent ID. | ✅ |
| `PUT` | `/categories/{id}` | Update a category | Protected by `@roles_required('admin')`; rejects duplicate names. | ✅ |
| `DELETE`| `/categories/{id}` | Delete a category | **Blocked with `409`** if any product or subcategory is still assigned to it. | ✅ |
| `GET` | `/products` | List all products | Tests dynamic filters (name, category, min/max price) & pagination. | ✅ |
| `GET` | `/products/slug/{slug}` | Get a product by its slug | Returns `404` for a non-existent or inactive slug. | ✅ |
| `POST` | `/products` | Add new product | Auto-generates UUID slug, validates stock/price constraints via `ProductCreateSchema`. | ✅ |
| `PUT` | `/products/{id}` | Update product | Regenerates slug ONLY if the product name is changed. | ✅ |
| `DELETE`| `/products/{id}` | Delete a product | Owning seller **or admin**. **Blocked with `409`** if the product is tied to a `pending`, `processing`, or `shipped` order. | ✅ |

### 4. Cart & Checkout (`/carts`, `/orders`)
| Method | Endpoint | Description | Testing Criteria | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST` | `/carts/items` | Add to cart | Prevents sellers from buying their own products, checks stock. | ✅ |
| `POST` | `/orders/checkout` | Process transaction | Successfully splits 1 cart into multiple distinct seller orders, each with a UUID identifier. | ✅ |
| `GET` | `/orders` | Get user orders | Filters by `?status=`, searches by `?product=`, sorts by `?sort=asc/desc`, paginated. | ✅ |
| `PUT` | `/orders/{id}/status`| Update logistics | Enforces the [status state machine](#order-lifecycle-state-machine); admins can act on any order, sellers manage shipping, buyers can only cancel from `pending`. | ✅ |
| `DELETE`| `/orders/{id}` | Soft-delete an order record | Only succeeds when order status is `cancelled`; otherwise rejected with `400`. | ✅ |

## Postman E2E Workflow & Security Testing

While Swagger UI provides excellent endpoint-level interaction, the complete business lifecycles and security edge cases (Negative Testing) are documented and tested using Postman. This collection contains a comprehensive suite of API requests divided into core testing modules:

* **1. Auth & Identity:** JWT token generation, role extraction, and automated environment variable scripting for seamless testing.
* **2. Catalog Management:** Dynamic product filtering, slug-based lookup, category hierarchy management, and seller/admin-restricted CRUD operations.
* **3. Cart & Checkout:** Active prevention of cart exploits (negative quantity injections, out-of-stock bypassing) and the core execution of the **Split-Order Checkout** architecture.
* **4. Order Management:** End-to-end lifecycle tracking respecting the [state machine](#order-lifecycle-state-machine), allowing buyers to view order history and sellers to update logistics statuses.
* **5. Security & RBAC:** Active testing against Horizontal Privilege Escalation (IDOR) and role-based status manipulation (e.g., providing `403 Forbidden` proofs when sellers attempt to cancel orders, and `409 Conflict` proofs when any role attempts an illegal status jump).
* **7. System Health:** Verifies `GET /health` returns proper HTTP semantics for uptime monitoring.

## Future Enhancements

To further optimize the marketplace ecosystem and elevate the system to enterprise-grade standards, the following features are planned for future iterations:

*   **Distributed Rate Limiting:** Migrating `Flask-Limiter`'s storage backend from in-memory to a Redis-backed store, so rate limits are enforced consistently across all Gunicorn worker processes rather than per-worker (see [Infrastructure & Deployment Readiness](#infrastructure--deployment-readiness)).
*   **Advanced Authentication:** Implementing a dual-token `JWT architecture (Access & Refresh Tokens)` with Token Freshness to improve UX and secure sensitive endpoints.
*   **Direct Checkout API:** Building a decoupled `"Buy Now"` route to bypass the cart state, reducing user friction for single-item purchases.
*   **API Versioning:** Introducing a `/api/v1/` prefix ahead of any breaking changes, to support long-term client compatibility.

> ✅ Several items previously listed here have since been completed: request/response validation now runs through dedicated **Marshmallow DTO schemas** in a layered MCS architecture, database schema evolution is managed via **Flask-Migrate**, **rate limiting** protects auth endpoints, a **CI pipeline** runs the full test suite on every push, categories support a **multi-level hierarchy**, orders use **UUID identifiers** with an **enforced state machine**, and the **health check** returns correct HTTP status semantics (see [Infrastructure & Deployment Readiness](#infrastructure--deployment-readiness)). The application is also fully **containerized** and **live-deployed** (see [Containerization](#containerization-docker) and [Cloud Architecture](#cloud-architecture-railway)).
